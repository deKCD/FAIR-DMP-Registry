It is a free file hosting platform, it does not constraint which data are stored and do not follow complex metadata or formats. It can be extended and adapted using plugins, such as a plugin to integrate an office suite, such as LibreOffice. As such, it should be considered a support application before all: a tool to support your work, or a way to store data for other applications. The absence of constraint makes it a poor choice for FAIR data storage, as the users would need to do most of the needed work. Still, interconnected via API to other Software, it could be an essential part of a Data Management solution, even if only as a scrapbook. NextCloud has an extensive API, so could be used with constraint via the API using a dedicated Pipeline. It could be with connection with another application or for a specific use-case.\nDocker, Docker compose and Kubernetes installation, with Helm chart\nExtensive API\nInteroperability HIGH: The API is well documented and there is several ways of doing things. Then NextCloud is highly flexible, so the use will need to be defined clearly and there might need to restrict it using the API for uploads in order to integrate it in an assembly.\nFully cross-domain",
