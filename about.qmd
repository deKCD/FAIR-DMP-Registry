As part of the [De.KCD project](https://datenkompetenz.cloud/) this registry lists some of the major Data-Management platforms over various scientific domains in a short summary with a focus on how suited they are to a cloud environment, including their interoperability.

All contributions are welcome so feel free to submit an issue or a pull request to add or edit. If you have been involved in the development of a Data-Management platform, we would be very happy for any correction or addition.
